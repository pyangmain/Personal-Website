                                Typical class in undergraduate algebra, covering a good amount of group theory, covering all the basic definitions and theorems, as well as some extra content (group isometries and representation theory). 
                                I personally struggled a bit in this class, not because I thought it was particular hard, but I thought that the content was poorly motivated (which admittedly is a bit of a me problem).
                                The beginning is pretty chill, but for us it ramped up significantly when covering the sylow theorems, group isometries, and representation theory units. Note that the content covered in this class
                                is heavily instructor dependent (but almost always has a pretty decent curve).

                                Really enjoyed this class! Personally, I view pretty much all the CS upper electives as survey courses, and in that regard 
                                there are a couple that I personally feel aren't worth taking (lack of rigor in 445 comes to mind), but 485 embraces that aspect, covering such a wide swath of topics and technologies. It doesn't do any of topics 
                                in great detail, mind you, but the course does such a great job motivating you to pick out the topics you enjoyed and explore them in greater detail in other upper-level eecs classes if you should wish to do so.
                                I would STRONGLY recommend taking this class as your first upper-level eecs requirement, as it helps you understand what other upper levels you want to take. In terms of workload, it's pretty heavy, but if you have a good group,
                                all the projects should be slightly easier than 281 projects. It's also a great resume builder. By the end of the class, you can add to your resume: 2 programming languages (Python and Javascript), a frontend and backend framework (flask and React.js),
                                A full-stack project (P3), and a distributed systems project (P4 and P5).

                                Graduate (Masters) version of stats 413, covering roughly the same content. Mostly focused on applications, with easy math derivations on the homework. The content covered in this
                                class is substantial, and useful if you want a good background in linear models for machine learning. Overall, the class was good for learning techniques, however, I felt that the lecture
                                didn't put much emphasis on the mathematical reasoning for some of the methods, and felt more like "heres the r-code, now do it". Granted the math aspect of the class isn't the focus, so it's more of 
                                just a personal gripe. As for advice, the course defintely ramps up after the first midterm. Try to understand the main ideas and intuition behind the models, and if you are curious on the 
                                mathematical background, study it on your own or take Stats 600.

                                This class is often described as the litmus test for whether or not you like systems or not, and has me firmly placed in the "non-systems" camp. I can't tell 
                                if it's just because the course is structured poorly, as i've heard that 370 and 376 are both not great introductions to those subjects in cs from people that are in systems and theory respectively,
                                but I couldn't watch a 370 lecture without my eyes glazing over. The projects are all really simple, if you go to lecture it will probably take you 5-10 hours per project. The midterms and exams are notoriously difficult,
                                but if you do the previous exams, you'll probably survive. It's worth noting that the variance in difficulty in 370 exams is crazy high, often you'll have semesters in which the median is 50, and one where the median is 70. 
                                Overall, a pretty typical workload class that I thought was unfortunately very boring.

                                Pretty typical undergraduate level course in Complex Analysis, covering pretty much all the major definitions and theorems. I personally
                                struggled quite a bit working in the complex plane, as the definitions become a bit wonky, and lose a lot of intuition when working outside the reals. 
                                General advice would be just to remember the major definitions (Cauchy's integral/derivative formulas, Liouville's theorem, Argument principle, Residue theory come to mind the most)
                                and gain a good understanding of complex arithmetic early (seriously, this class is a lot of arithmetic).
                                My professor, Ahmad Barhoumi was great! despite this being the first time he taught a 500 level course. Super down to earth and approachable guy, also has practically native level english skills

                              A course in Statistical Theory and Inference at the graduate level using Casella & Berger. To be honest, I felt that the 
                              course was a bit dry and lacking in rigor, with a lot of the proofs being hand-wavy or just sketches. Statistics being the field that it is 
                              leaves a lot of lacking for the motivation behind lots of definitions, but this was pretty much the first statistics course i've ever taken so take my
                              opinion with a grain of salt. It was cool seeing the derivations and reasoning behind common stuff you could see in an intro statistics course(Z and T tests, MLE, Hypothesis testing, Confidence intervals, etc). 
                              My professor, Kean Tan Ming, was super great and a real funny guy, his office hours were able to demystify pretty much anything you had trouble with. If you are 
                              considering taking STATS 426, whether it be for a degree requirement or just personal interest, I HEAVILY HEAVILY recommend you take STATS 511 instead. It counts as an override for 426 and has a ridiculously generous curve (look it up on atlas if you don't believe me).

                              Yikes this class was a lot of work. Overall, the concepts covered in lecture aren't really that difficult, but the questions they ask you about it on the exams are pretty difficult.
                              Generally speaking, the advice I would give you would be to do a lot of leetcoding beforehand, as the exam FRQS and lab questions are literally just rewritten leetcode questions. This kills two birds with one stone if you are also looking to get a SWE internship. 
                              Make sure to learn most of the core Data Structures and Algorithms (no pun intended) beforehand (Stack/Queue & Priority Queue/Hashmap/BST/DP). If you are familiar with these topics, 
                              it really isn't worth your time to go to lecture. I personally never went to lecture and subsisted entirely on lab recordings, and it seemed to be enough to get by. As everyone says, start projects early, as no matter
                              how well you know the material, it will still end up being a timesink. Paoletti and Darden teach this class pretty much every semester, and both of them are top notch professors.

                                Depending on how comfortable you were in 203, this class will range from being a fairly light introduction to the theory of computation, or will be 
                                the absolute bane of your existence. Homeworks for the most part felt pretty handholdy and not too difficult to complete on your own, but I am also a biased math major so 
                                please see how comfortable you are with the first few homeworks and plan accordingly. Lecture sometimes seemed pretty disjoint with the questions on the homework, I mostly used the course notes
                                they provided and the discussion notes and worksheets to learn the material. I would say that this course more than others, going to lab is useful to understand what is actually going on. Leqi(Jimmy) Zhu 
                                was a funny and empathethic instructor, who is unfortunately leaving for the University of Toronto next semester.

                              This class was great! If you like probability, then you will for sure like this class. Tons of applications to queueing theory, machine learning,
                              financial math, control systems, biology, (the list goes on and on). One thing I will say is that we skim over a lot of the proofs, and the class can be
                              a little hand-wavy at times, but that is not the fault of the instructor or the class, as you have to cover a lot of non-trivial content without the use 
                              of measure theory, which obviously means you have to leave some stuff out to fit it all in a semester. Homeworks usually were not that bad, but it defintely becomes harder as the 
                              semester went on. Asaf Cohen, my instructor, was probably the best 
                              math instructor I have ever had. Super knowledgable and patient guy, providing tons of intuition to all the theorems and definitions. 100% recommend taking the class with him
                              if you have the chance.

                              Solid class that covers a lot of the underlying architecture used for data structures (classes, pointers, iterators, polymorphism, operator overloading, the new keyword, etc). 
                              Taking this class with only a Java background, I can honestly say that i've been converted to C++ supremacy. You really gain a newfound appreciation for how the underlying
                              mechanisms of things that are taken for granted in other languages. For example, most other languages don't even go over pointer semantics or the new keyword, although most use it. 
                              I highly recommend using the online textbook (Runestone) that was graciously given by the 280 staff, I personally just used that and never went to a single in-person lecture (although lectures are all recorded if you are into that).
                              My only piece of advice would be to get good at using the debugger and starting projects early.

                              interesting, but it seemed so basic and surface-level that it was hard to do the readings without my eyes instantly glazing over. I would recommend taking SOC 300 if you are 
                              actually interested in Sociology, or to seek out more interesting courses if you are looking for Social Science credit.

                              As intro to programming courses go, this one felt wayyy too long. I feel like if I had the chance to do this class over,
                               I could learn all the content in 2-3 weeks instead of stretching it out over an entire semester. I would highly recommend 
                               self-studying and requesting an override into COMP SCI 300 or taking an accelerated course at a community college and transferring it over as credit instead of taking this class.

                              This class (despite what CS majors tell you), didn't feel that hard. You may struggle with proofs in the beginning, but after a while it isn't so bad.
                              Keep in mind that this class is cross-listed as math, with the cs department teaching in the fall and the math department teaching in the winter. If you are a cs/ce major, 
                              I would heavily recommend taking this class with the cs department in the fall, as it prepares you better for Intro. to Algorithms.

                              This class for me was a hard introduction to proofs. The class was very abstract compared to the math courses I had taken in the past, and many times I was left wondering
                              what I was even doing. That being said, this class defintely reaffirmed my decision to major in math, and gave me a deeper appreciation of the rigor in upper-level mathematics. 
                              If you are at all considering majoring in mathematics, I would defintely recommend taking this class, especially if you are already majoring in computer science, as linear algebra is 
                              incredibly important for many upper-level electives(ML, Optimization, Cryptography, etc).

                              This class serves as a way to see the theory behind Calc 1, and a good introduction to proofs. We used Spivak's Calculus as our textbook. The assignments were usually pretty tough, but the exams in comparison 
                              were easier. If you are confident in your proof skills, I would say to 
                              skip this class and take Analysis, but if you want a little more practice with proofs, this class is for sure a good choice. This class pretty much covers the second half of MATH 521: Analysis

                              unintuitive, exams were easier in comparison. A lot of math topics were mentioned but not deeply covered(Borel Sigma-Algebras, Lebesgue Integral, Characteristic functions). I would recommend taking MATH: 431 as your first introduction to probability

                              Despite the general sentiment on Real Analysis, I didn't think this class was that bad(granted I took MATH 421 beforehand). Baby Rudin is concise, but often times to a fault. He would often just flat out
                              omit important details in proofs. Chapters 2 and 3 were especially hard, but if you gain a good grasp of those two chapters, the rest of the book will follow nicely. Maxim was super chill and a good professor,
                              don't listen to the people who badmouth him for the one semester he taught MATH 340 during covid.

                              Compared to COMP SCI 200, this class was a lot more work. Programming assignments were pretty time consuming, but the topics covered weren't that hard to grasp. Exams and Homework were also pretty easy. 
                              I would recommend learning git/github in conjunction with this class, as it serves as a good way to archive your code, as well as learn software that you will use for the rest of your computer science career. If possible,
                              take this class with Hobbes Legault. She should be referred to as Hobbes LeGOAT. She's incredibly charismatic, her lectures are engaging and informative, and just has good vibes across the board.

                              If I had to describe this class in one word it would be tedious. This class isn't hard in the slightest, but you cover pretty dull subjects and spend your time tracing code and converting between numeral systems.
                              The silver lining is that exams are virtually identical to the homework, so just study the homework and exams won't be bad.

                              I never thought I would be taught Japanese by a Turkish person, but it turned out to be a great experience! Bozeru sensei is super enthusiastic and attentive to questions. Attendance for this class was mandatory, which was great(atleast for me), as I was able to 
                              interact a lot with my classmates. Just know that if you take this class, you either are a weeb, or will be surrounded by them. Overall a very chill class and good introduction to the Japanese language.
